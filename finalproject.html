        <h2>Concept Description</h2>
        <p>A chest tube insertion trainer for medical staff to sense when they have
          gone too deep in their incision/puncture during the procedure. Chest
          tube insertion involves cutting into the chest wall, puncturing the parietal
          pleura, and inserting a tube into the pleural space.

        <h2>Bill of Materials</h2>
        <p>The only component I needed to purchase were the 10 Mohm resistors. However, if I were
          to redo this project, I would likely attempt to use a weaker resistor.

        <h2>Schematic</h2>
        <p>For this schematic, each LED is connected to its own pin and resistor. The button
          is also connected to its own pin to sense whether it is pressed or not, as well as a 10k
          ohm resistor (chosen to act as a pulldown resistor), and 5V power. The capacitive sensor is
          connected to a 10M ohm resistor (so that it will sense a few inches away from the sensor) and 2 pins,
          a sending and receiving pin.

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Code</h2>
    <p>
1) Set up variables and capacitive sensor library <br>
2) Initialize pins as OUTPUTs and INPUTs, begin serial monitor, and calibrate the capacitive sensor<br>
3) Create a for loop that smoothes the input from the capacitive sensor<br>
4) Depending on the input, a different LED will turn on/off<br>
5) When the button is pressed, the capacitive sensor will recalibrate itself.<br>

  //gets reading from capacitive sensor with 30 samples

  // for 5 readings, add up the inputs from the cs
  for (int i=0; i < 5; i++) {
    long output = cs.capacitiveSensor(30);
    smoothOutput = smoothOutput + output;
  }

  //divide the summed input by 5 to get it to smooth out
  smoothOutput = smoothOutput / 5;

  //if the button is pressed, reset the capacitive sensor
  buttonstate = digitalRead(buttonpin);
  if (buttonstate == HIGH) {
    cs.reset_CS_AutoCal();
  }

  //turns on the correct LED depending on the reading from the cs
  if (smoothOutput > 10000) { //too close
    digitalWrite(redled, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(blueled, LOW);
    digitalWrite(greenled, LOW);
  } else if (smoothOutput > 2000 && smoothOutput < 10000) { //just right
    digitalWrite(redled, LOW);
    digitalWrite(blueled, LOW);
    digitalWrite(greenled, HIGH);  
  } else { //too far away
    digitalWrite(redled, LOW);
    digitalWrite(blueled, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(greenled, LOW);
  }

  //print sensor output
  Serial.println(smoothOutput);

    <h2>Technical Writeup: Physical Components</h2>
    <h3>To Make the Silicone</h3>
    <p>I mixed part A with pigments and flocking to obtain the correct color, then I mixed in part B.
      For the P70, the ratio of part A to B is 10:1. For the Ecoflex Gel 00, the ratio of part A to B is 1:1.
      After, I degassed the mixture in a vacuum chamber and poured into a tray from a high height to get rid of remaining
      bubbles. After a few hours, the silicone set. For the skin, I brushed baby powder on one side to make it smooth.
      The capacitive sensor itself was a silicone lung-shaped object
      wrapped in aluminum foil. For the purposes of this project, any lung-shaped object wrapped in foil that can be clipped with
      an alligator clip will work.

    </div>
    <h3>To Make the Enclosure</h3>
    <p>I 3D-printed the enclosure using white Hatchbox PLA filament on a Prusa. To model it, I used
      SolidWorks and created a box with an opening to contain the arduino/perfboard,
      a lid with holes to show the LEDs and utilize the button, and a stick for the button to be pressed.
      To create it, I had to measure the dimensions of the arduino and placements of the LEDs with calipers and tolerance the drawing.
      The ribs were also 3D printed a while ago using SolidWorks. For exact dimensions, download the STL files here:

    <h2>Final Product & Video Demo</h2>
    <p>The final product was (from deep to superficial) aluminum-covered silicone lungs, 3D printed ribs,
      silicone parietal pleura, and silicone subcutaneous + skin + baby powder. When the metal Kelly clamps
      get close to the lungs, the capacitive sensor senses it, smoothes it, and writes a long variable 
      to the serial monitor. This code turns on the correct LED according to this number and turns the other LEDs off.
      When the button is pressed, the capacitive sensor is re-calibrated.
