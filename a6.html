        <h2>Schematic</h2>
        <p>My schematic has 2 buttons (Inputs) and 3 LEDs (Outputs). Each button is connected to 
          an analog pin that reads the state of the button, while each LED is connected to a 
          digital pin that controls whether the LED is on or off. 
        </p>

        <h2>Circuit Image</h2>
        <p>Each button has a 10k ohm resistor that I chose because I wanted to button to be a 
          pull-down resistor because it prevents short circuiting while the button is pushed down and
          pulls down the input to ground when the button is not pushed.
          <br>
          For my LEDs, I chose 220 ohm resistors for each of them. 
          <pre>
Red LED:
5 - 1.8V = ? Amperes * 220 Ohms
I = 14.5 mA

Green/Blue LED:
5 - 3.3V = ? Amperes * 220 Ohms
I = 7.7 mA

        <h2>Circuit Video </h2>
        <h3>(Full Screen Allowed)</h1>
        <p>When button 1 is pushed, the arduino uses Serial.print to write "High" to the serial
          monitor. When button 2 is pushed, it writes "Gray". A function in p5 reads this and
          changes the background color of the sketch depending on what it reads. When button 1 is 
          pushed, it changes the background color to a random color. When button 2 is pushed, the
          background color returns to the default light gray. 
          <br>
          When the user uses the mouse to click on an LED, p5 uses port.write to write a 
          predetermined single byte (0 to 255) to the serial monitor. This is read by the arduino sketch
          using Serial.read. Depending on the byte that is read, it will turn the corresponding
          LED on or off. The code that uses port.write to turn the actual LEDs on/off will also
          change the color of the p5sketch LED so that it matches the real life LED.

    <h2>Arduino Code Sketch</h2>
    <p>First, I defined my global variables, initialized the pins, and started the serial monitor.
      Then, I used variables to store the state of my buttons and used them to write to the serial
      monitor if they were pushed. Finally, I used Serial.read() to check what was being written
      to the monitor. If it was a byte that the code recognized, it would turn on/off the corresponding
      LED using digitalWrite().
    </p>

        <code>
//defining variables
int redpin = 5;
int bluepin = 7;
int greenpin = 11;
int buttonpin = A0;
int buttonState = 0;
int button2pin = A3;
int button2State = 0;
int incomingByte = 0;

void setup() {
  //initializing pins as INPUTs or OUTPUTs
  pinMode(redpin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(bluepin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(greenpin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(buttonpin, INPUT);
  pinMode(button2pin, INPUT);

  //begining serial monitor
  Serial.begin(9600);

}

void loop() {
  //setting variables to read the state of the button (high or low)
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonpin);
  button2State = digitalRead(button2pin);

  //if the first button is pressed, print "High" to serial monitor
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    Serial.print("High\n");
  }

  //if second button is pressed, print "Low" to serial monitor
  //when the p5 sketch reads these, it will change the background color
  if (button2State == HIGH) {
    Serial.print("Gray\n");

    <h2>P5 Code Sketch (p5.js)</h2>
    <p>First, I setup class LED that passed a lot of variables through (such as x, y position,
      color of the LED, the byte code for turning it on/off, and the radius). The class had 
      functions to display/draw the LEDs and turn them "on" or "off" by changing the color of
      the LED and writing to the serial monitor (port.write) the single byte that would be read
      by the arduino code. The function readingMonitor was also set up to read the serial monitor
      for "High\n" and "Gray\n" which would trigger a change in the sketch's background color.
      To set up the serial monitor, I utilized https://github.com/gohai/p5.webserial
      and the helper functions from Hannah's examples. I also set up functions for mousePressed, which
      turned the LEDs on and off when the mouse clicked on them, and randomC, which returns a 
      random color.
