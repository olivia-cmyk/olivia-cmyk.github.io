        <h2>Schematic</h2>
        <p>The capacitor (metal sheet) is set up to be a touch sensitive capacitive sensor, attached to pins 4 (sending pin) and 2
            (receiving pin), with a 1 Mohm resistor connecting them. The LED strip is connected to
            an external power supply and N-MOSFET transistor. The max current that the transistor can handle
            is 32A. According to the LED strip box, the LED strips only draw 1.5A of current.

        <h2>Circuit Image</h2>
        <p>For my capacitor, I used a scrap metal sheet and a 1 Mohm resistor. I chose the 1 Mohm
            resistor according to the capacitive sensor library documentation (https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor/index-2.html)
            to respond to absolute touch.
            For the high-load output device, I used the LED strips.

        <h2>Circuit Video </h2>
        <h3>(Full Screen Allowed)</h1>
        <p>When the capacitive sensor is touched, the send and recieve pin of the capacitor
            time how long it takes for the recieve pin to match the send pin, which will return
            larger or smaller numbers. The code maps these numbers to 0-255, which will be written
            to the gate pin (9) of the transistor. This will turn the LED strip on to the associated
            brightness.

    <h2>Arduino Code Sketch</h2>
    <p>In my code, I included the capacitive sensor library and set up the capacitive sensor pins,
      as well as the gatepin for the N-MOSFET transistor. After getting a reading from the sensor,
      the code constrains the input to a min and max, and then maps it to brightnesses between
      0 and 255 in order to write that to the gate pin and change the brightness of the LEDs.

      <h3>1: This is the datasheet for the n-mosfet transistor:
        https://www.diodes.com/assets/Datasheets/DMT6009LCT.pdLinks to an
