        <h2>Schematic</h2>
        <p>The capacitor (metal sheet) is set up to be a touch sensitive capacitive sensor, attached to pins 4 (sending pin) and 2
            (receiving pin), with a 1 Mohm resistor connecting them. The LED strip is connected to
            an external power supply and N-MOSFET transistor. The max current that the transistor can handle
            is 32A. According to the LED strip box, the LED strips only draw 1.5A of current.

        <h2>Circuit Image</h2>
        <p>For my capacitor, I used a scrap metal sheet and a 1 Mohm resistor. I chose the 1 Mohm
            resistor according to the capacitive sensor library documentation (https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor/index-2.html)
            to respond to absolute touch.
            For the high-load output device, I used the LED strips.

        <h2>Circuit Video </h2>
        <h3>(Full Screen Allowed)</h1>
        <p>When the capacitive sensor is touched, the send and recieve pin of the capacitor
            time how long it takes for the recieve pin to match the send pin, which will return
            larger or smaller numbers. The code maps these numbers to 0-255, which will be written
            to the gate pin (9) of the transistor. This will turn the LED strip on to the associated
            brightness.

    <h2>Arduino Code Sketch</h2>
    <p>In my code, I included the capacitive sensor library and set up the capacitive sensor pins,
      as well as the gatepin for the N-MOSFET transistor. After getting a reading from the sensor,
      the code constrains the input to a min and max, and then maps it to brightnesses between
      0 and 255 in order to write that to the gate pin and change the brightness of the LEDs.

//includes library in code
#include &lt;CapacitiveSensor.h&gt; 
//sets variables for pins
int gatepin = 9;
//sets pins 4 and 2 and sending and receiving pins
CapacitiveSensor cs = CapacitiveSensor(4,2);

void setup() {
  //turns off autocalibrate
  cs.set_CS_AutocaL_Millis(0xFFFFFFFF);
  //initializes gatepin as output
  pinMode(gatepin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  //creates a long variable to store milliseconds since starting
  long start = millis();
  //gets reading from capacitive sensor with 30 samples
	long output =  cs.capacitiveSensor(30);
  //constrains the reading from the capacitive sensor to 70 and 1800
  int constrainedInput = constrain(output, 80, 1700);
  //maps the reading fro the capacitive sensor to angles for the servo motor
  int brightness = map(constrainedInput, 80, 1700, 0, 255);

  //writes the brightness to the gatepin, which will turn on the LED to the brightness
  analogWrite(gatepin, brightness);
  //delays for 2/100 of a second
  delay(20);

      <h3>3: Here is the datasheet for the L293D chip: https://www.ti.com/product/L293D
        Draw a schematic using at least your arduino, this chip, and two motors. Write (pseudo)
        code that shows how you would move the motors both forward, both back, then one forward
        one back, and one back then forward.

        <img src="a5_qna_q3.jpg"/>
        <p>
          Pseudocode: 
          First, initialize pins 1, 2, 3, and 4 as outputs using pinMode(). Then, to move both motors
          in the same direction (counterclockwise), you would put pins 1 and 3 on high, and pins 2 and 4 on low
          using digitalWrite(). To move them both in the opposite direction, pins 1+3 would be low and 2+4 would be high.
          To do opposite directions, pin 1+4 = high and pins 3+2 = low, and vice versa to switch the directions again.
