        <h2>Schematic</h2>
        <p>To get each of the LEDs to blink independently, I used 3 different power sources
          the Arduino so that I could code each one to turn on/off separately for different
          lengths of time.

        <h2>Circuit Image</h2>
        <p>For my circuit, I used 3 red LEDs and 3 220 Ohm resistors. I chose 220 Ohms because
          I calculated that the LEDs being on at the ideal 20 mA current would require 160 Ohm resistors
          which I did not have. 220 Ohms resulted in 14 mA current, still sufficiently turning on the lights.
        </p>
        <pre>

5-1.8 Volts = 0.02 Amperes * R
3.2 Volts / 0.02 Amperes = 160 Ohms
          
3.2 Volts = ? Amperes * 220 Ohms
Current = 0.014 Amperes

        <p>As per the schematic, each LED has its own power source connected to its anode and
          its cathode goes to ground to complete the circuit.

        <h2>Arduino Code Sketch</h2>
        <p>In the code setup, I initialized each of the pins I wanted to use as a power source.
          Then in the loop, I cycled through each pin making the LED connected to it turn on for
          a fraction of a second, then wait before the next one turned on.
