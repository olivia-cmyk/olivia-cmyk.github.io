        <h2>Schematic</h2>
        <p>I attached each LED to a different digital pin so they could fade independently.
        The A0 analog pin is attached to the LDR to take readings of the voltage based on the
        amount of light available to the LDR.

        <h2>Circuit Image</h2>
        <p>For my circuit, I used 2 yellow LEDs with 220 Ohm resistors, as well as a Light Dependent
            Resistor with a 10k Ohm resistor. For a 20mA current, each yellow LED would need 160 Ohm resistors.
            With the 220 Ohm resistors, their current would be 14mA. For the LDR, it is attached to a 10k
            Ohm resistor in the case that the light available cuases the LDR to be 0 Ohms. 
        </p>
        <pre>

5-1.8 Volts = 0.02 Amperes * R
3.2 Volts / 0.02 Amperes = 160 Ohms
          
3.2 Volts = ? Amperes * 220 Ohms
Current = 0.014 Amperes

        <h3>(Full Screen Allowed)</h1>
        <p>As per the schematic, each LED is connected to a pin to fade on/off independently.
            When the resistor is exposed to a lot of light, its resistance decreases and the A0
            pin reads a higher number. This higher number correlates to a high number for the LEDs
            (on a 0 to 255 scale). One LED thus increases in brightness while the other uses the opposite
            brightness number (255-brightness) and dims. When the LED is not exposed to a lot of light,
            the opposite happens.

    <h2>Arduino Code Sketch</h2>
    <p>In my code, I first set up variables to make changing pins easier if needed, 
      initialized the pins to Outputs and Inputs as needed, and started the serial monitor.
      Within the loop, I read the value from the sensing pin and contstrained and mapped it 
      to appropriate values for the LEDs to use. It was constrained to 520 and 830 instead of 0
      and 1023 because those are the min and max values that were being read when tested in a 
      fairly lit room. If I had used 0 and 1023, the LEDs would not turn all the way on or off.
      Finally, I turned on the LEDs based on this
      number and wrote to the serial what the brightness number was, as well as whether each
      LED was bright or not.

    <h2>Additional Questions:</h2>

    <div class="qna">
      <h3>1: In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does
        it need to be one or the other? Justify your answer with example calculations.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Yes, in my schematic, the variable resistor is currently R1, but changing it to R2 will
        still work. However, I might need to change to code as it changes the voltage that the
        sensor reads.
        <pre>
            <code>
                Example: In a lit room, the LDR = about 6k Ohms
                Vout = Vin (R2/(R1+R2))

                If photoresistor is R1:
                5V (10k/(16k)) = 3.125 V

                If photoresistor is R2:
                5V (6k/16k) = 1.875 V

      <h3>3: AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. Imagine
        you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this
        change your map() code? Explain your answer.</h3>
      <p>
        You would need to map the 16 bit values (max number being 65535) to
        10 bit values (max being 1023).
        The code would now be int outputValue = map(value, 0, 65535, 0, 1023); although I might have to constrain
        the exact numbers so that my LEDs turn all the way off.
