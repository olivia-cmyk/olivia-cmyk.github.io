        <h2>Schematic</h2>
        <p>The capacitor (metal sheet) is set up to be a touch sensitive capacitive sensor, attached to pins 4 (sending pin) and 2
            (receiving pin), with a 1 Mohm resistor connecting them. The servo motor is connected to
            ground, 5V power, and pin 9, which outputs PWM to the motor.

        <h2>Circuit Image</h2>
        <p>For my capacitor, I used a scrap metal sheet and a 1 Mohm resistor. I chose the 1 Mohm
            resistor according to the capacitive sensor library documentation (https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor/index-2.html)
            to respond to absolute touch.

        <h2>Circuit Video </h2>
        <h3>(Full Screen Allowed)</h1>
        <p>When the capacitive sensor is touched, the send and recieve pin of the capacitor
            time how long it takes for the recieve pin to match the send pin, which will return
            larger or smaller numbers. The code maps these numbers to 0-180 angle degrees and moves
            the motor to that degree.

    <h2>Arduino Code Sketch</h2>
    <p>In my code, I included the two libraries I was using and set them up with pins, as well as began the serial
        monitor. Then, I get a reading from the capacitive sensor, constrain it to a min and max,
        and map it to angles between 0 and 180. Then, I move the motor to that angle and wait 1 
        second before taking a reading again.

    <h2>Additional Questions:</h2>

    <div class="qna">
      <h3>1: Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. In your loop() you have the following code:
        for (int i=0, i&lt;180, i++){servo.write(i); delay(100);}
        Draw a graph with the X axis in seconds, for two seconds, and the y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.

      <h3>2: Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous
        reading 1% of the time. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.
      </h3>
      <pre>
//creates long variable to sum inputs
long sum = 0;

//sums up last 15 readings at a time
for (int i=0; i&lt;15; i++) {
    long input =  cs.capacitiveSensor(30);
    sum = sum + input;
    delay(100);
}

//creates variable for smoothedInput
int smoothedInput = (sum/15);

----OR----

//prevent too-high or too-low values
int constInput = constrain(input, min, max);

//now use the above smoothing code.
      </pre>
      <h3>3: Your input device is slightly noisy, leading the measurement to randomly
        deviate from the true measurement up or down by 10%. How can we address this?
        Answer in (pseudo)code.
