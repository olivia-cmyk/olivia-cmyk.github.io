        <h2>Schematic</h2>
        <p>I used Pin 2 to take the reading from the button (to tell if it was pushed),
          and Pins 13 and 11 to control different RGB LEDs in the colors of turquoise (G+B) and
          purple (R+B). While the button was pushed, the purple LED was meant to fade on and
          off while the turquoise LED stayed on. Both LEDs turned off when the button was released.

        <h2>Circuit Image</h2>
        <p>For my circuit, I used 2 RGB LEDs and 1 button. For the button, I used a 10k Ohm resistor
          because this is the ideal resistance for a pull-down resistor because it prevents short circuiting
          while the button is pushed down and pulls down the input to ground when the button is not pushed.

          For the purple LED, I used 220 Ohm resistors. At the ideal 20 mA current, the R LED would require 160
          a Ohm resistor and the B LED would require 135 Ohms. Because I did not have these exact resistors, I chose
          220 Ohms, resulting in a 14mA (R) and 7.7mA (B) current. This means that my purple LED has a more red hue to it than 
          blue because I over-resisted the blue.
          
          For the turquoise LED, I used 1k Ohm resistors. I initially used 220 Ohm resistors, but the LED seemed too
          bright to me compared to the purple one and I wanted it to be slightly dimmer. The ideal resistor for B and G
          LEDs would be 135 Ohms, but with the 1k Ohm resistors, I got 1.7 mA of current for each LED. This dimmed the light slightly
          to a level I was satisfied with.

PURPLE LED CALCULATIONS:
5-1.8 Volts = 0.02 Amperes * R
R = 160 Ohms
5-3.3 Volts = 0.02 Amperes * R
R = 135 Ohms

//Red LED:
3.2 Volts = ? Amperes * 220 Ohms
I = 0.014 Amperes
//Blue LED:
1.7 Volts = ? Amperes * 220 Ohms
I = 0.0077 Amperes

TURQUOISE LED CALCULATIONS:
5-3.3 Volts = 0.02 Amperes * R
R = 135 Ohms

//Green and Blue LED:
1.7 Volts = ? Amperes * 1000 Ohms
I = 0.0017 Amperes

        <h2>Circuit GIF</h2>
        <p>As per the schematic, the button is connected to a 5V power source, as well as a 10k Ohm resistor,
          with Pin 2 collected readings from the button. Each LED is connected to resistors and individual pins
          so that one can fade on/off while the other just turns on.

    <h2>Arduino Code Sketch</h2>
    <p>In my code, I first set up variables to make changing pins easier if needed, and 
      initialized the pins to Outputs and Inputs as needed. In my loop, I made an if/else
      loop for when the button is pushed vs not pushed.

      In the if loop, I coded the turqouise LED to turn on, and used a for loop to fade the
      purple LED on and off while the button is pushed.

      In the else loop, I coded both LEDs to turn off.

        <code>
const int ledPin1 = 11; //sets LED to pin 11 (will be purple), can use analog write to fade
const int ledPin2 = 13; //sets LED to pin 13 (will be turquoise), uses digital write function
const int buttonPin = 2; //sets the button's pin to 2
int buttonState = 0; //sets variable buttonState to be 0

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin1, OUTPUT); //sets pin 11 as an output pin
  pinMode(ledPin2, OUTPUT); //sets pin 13 as an output pin
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT); //sets pin 2 as an input pin

}

void loop() {
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin); //reads whether or not button is pushed (HIGH) or not (LOW), sets it to buttonState

  //if loop for if the button is pressed
  if (buttonState == HIGH) { //if button is pressed...
    digitalWrite(ledPin2, HIGH); //turns on turquoise LED to high

    //for loop to fade the purple LED on
    for (int bright = 0; bright < 255; bright++) { //sets variable bright, active when bright < 255, bright inc. by 1 everytime it loops
      analogWrite(ledPin1, bright); //turns on purple LED to the current value of bright
      delay(9); //9/1000 second delay
    }

    analogWrite(ledPin1, 255); //turns on purple LED to brightest

    //for loop to fade the purple LED off

  } else { //else loop that is active when button is not being pushed.

      <h3>1: Draw a chart where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage.

      <h3>2: Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws
        current is your LEDs, how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh
        battery?
      </h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          (Accounting for resistors) Given the earlier calculations, the total current drawn
          by the schematic would be 25.1 mA (additive b/c they are parallel).
          This would mean that it would run for 47.8 hours on the battery.

          However, if we assume that each LED is drawing 20 mA of current, then we would draw
          a total of 80 mA. This would mean it would run for 15 hours.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
14mA + 7.7mA + 1.7mA + 1.7mA = 25.1 mA current
1200 mAh / 25.1 mA = 47.8 hours

20mA * 4 = 80 mA
1200 mAh / 80 mA = 15 hours
